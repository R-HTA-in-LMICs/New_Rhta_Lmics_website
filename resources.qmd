## 🔰 Basic R

- [Intro2R script](https://github.com/R-HTA-in-LMICs/June-Workshop/blob/main/R/Intro2R.R) — Input/output and object manipulation  
- [Intro tutorial materials](https://github.com/R-HTA-in-LMICs/June-Workshop)

## 🔁 Intermediate Modelling

**Based on DARTH materials:**

- [Time-Dependent Models paper (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13552)
- [Simulation script](https://github.com/R-HTA-in-LMICs/September-Workshop/blob/main/analysis/cSTM_time_dep_simulation.R)
- [State-residence time model](https://github.com/R-HTA-in-LMICs/September-Workshop/blob/main/analysis/Extra%20material%20-%20cSTM_time_dep_state_residence/cSTM_time_dep_state_residence.R)
- [Functions for analysis](https://github.com/R-HTA-in-LMICs/September-Workshop/tree/main/R)

## 🚀 Advanced & Interactive Modelling

- [Advanced HIV Markov model in R](https://github.com/R-HTA-in-LMICs/Advanced-Tutorial-2022)  
- [Explore interactive app](https://r-htalmics.shinyapps.io/hiv_model/)

> Shiny allows interactive web apps to communicate decision models intuitively.
