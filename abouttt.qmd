# About R-HTA in LMICs

R-HTA is a consortium focused on promoting the use of R for health economics and health technology assessment (HTA). While its core members are from the Americas and the UK—representing government institutions like [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/), academia, and industry—R-HTA aims to serve a global community of analysts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Our Vision

To empower LMIC (low- and middle-income countries) health systems with cutting-edge, reproducible, and accessible analytical tools for HTA using the R language.\
Learn more about our [workshops](workshops.qmd) and [learning resources](learning_resources.qmd) designed to build skills for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is R-HTA in LMICs?

The **R-HTA in LMICs chapter** is the regional arm of the R-HTA consortium. Its mission is to: - Introduce R as a viable alternative to costly software - Support LMIC analysts and institutions in adopting R for HTA - Share tailored educational resources and workshops

We believe that open-source tools like R can help bridge the digital and economic divide in health analysis, fostering a community that thrives on collaboration and shared innovation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Focus on LMICs?

HTA in LMICs is often constrained by: - Heavy reliance on proprietary software like Microsoft Excel and TreeAge - Limited budgets and access to advanced tools - Lack of hands-on, practical R training for HTA analysts

Meanwhile, health systems in LMICs are rapidly evolving, especially under the drive toward **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**. This creates a growing need for: - Complex modelling (e.g. oncology, rare diseases) - Scalable and reproducible tools - Local capacity-building

[Contact us](contact.qmd) to discuss how we can help bring these capabilities to your institution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What We Offer

-   **Workshops & Training Opportunities** — covering R, Health Technology Assessment (HTA), essential R packages, and practical tips for applying R in diverse contexts. Explore more on our [Workshops page](workshops.qmd).
-   **Advanced tutorials** — building cost-effectiveness models and interactive apps using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
-   **Free resources and code** — all available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/).

We work side-by-side with partners, offering mentoring, technical assistance, and bespoke solutions for regional health needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why R?

**Scalable**\
R handles complex HTA models more efficiently than spreadsheet-based tools. [Read more](https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1098-3015%2819%2930050-6)

**Reproducible**\
With Git, RMarkdown, and Shiny, models can be: - Shared with version control - Easily updated - Delivered as interactive tools

**Open and Community-Driven**\
R’s vibrant health economics ecosystem includes: - [BCEA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BCEA/index.html) - [heemod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/index.html) - [hesim](https://github.com/hesim-dev/hesim) - [dampack](https://github.com/feralaes/dampack)
