      description: >
        A comprehensive guide to the end-to-end use of R in health technology assessment (HTA), covering survival analysis, decision trees, multistate models, network meta-analysis, and discrete event simulation ‚Äî all explained through real-world examples with annotated R code. Ideal for HTA modellers, regulators, and health economists, enriched with case studies contributed by community members.
