The R for HTA in LMICs chapter is dedicated to introducing and showcasing the strengths of R programming to HTA analysts and healthcare institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It hosts an annual workshop and quarterly tutorials, providing a platform where LMIC students and members of partner organisations can present their work, share experiences, and learn a wide range of R-based public health analysis techniques.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Our Vision\n\nTo empower LMIC (low- and middle-income countries) health systems with cutting-edge, reproducible, and accessible analytical tools for HTA using the R language.\\\nLearn more about our [workshops](workshops.qmd) and [learning resources](learning_resources.qmd) designed to build skills for both beginners and experienced practitioners.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What is R-HTA in LMICs?\n\nThe **R-HTA in LMICs chapter** is the regional arm of the R-HTA consortium. Its mission is to:\n\n-   Introduce R as a viable alternative to costly software\n-   Support LMIC analysts and institutions in adopting R for HTA\n-   Share tailored educational resources and workshops\n\nWe believe that open-source tools like R can help bridge the digital and economic divide in health analysis, fostering a community that thrives on collaboration and shared innovation.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Why Focus on LMICs?\n\nHTA in LMICs is often constrained by: - Heavy reliance on proprietary software like Microsoft Excel and TreeAge - Limited budgets and access to advanced tools - Lack of hands-on, practical R training for HTA analysts\n\nMeanwhile, health systems in LMICs are rapidly evolving, especially under the drive toward **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**. This creates a growing need for: - Complex modelling (e.g. oncology, rare diseases) - Scalable and reproducible tools - Local capacity-building\n\n[Contact us](contact.qmd) to discuss how we can help bring these capabilities to your institution.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What We Offer\n\n-   **Workshops & Training Opportunities** — covering R, Health Technology Assessment (HTA), essential R packages, and practical tips for applying R in diverse contexts.
