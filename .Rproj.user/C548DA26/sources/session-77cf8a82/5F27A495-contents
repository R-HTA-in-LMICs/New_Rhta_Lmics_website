# About R-HTA in LMICs

[R-HTA](https://r-hta.org/) is a consortium focused on promoting the use of R for health economics and health technology assessment (HTA). While its core members are from the Americas and the UKâ€”representing government institutions like [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/), academia, and industryâ€”R-HTA aims to serve a global community of analysts.

## Our Vision

To empower LMIC (low- and middle-income countries) health systems with cutting-edge, reproducible, and accessible analytical tools for HTA using the R language.

## What is R-HTA in LMICs?

The **R-HTA in LMICs chapter** is the regional arm of the R-HTA consortium. Its mission is to:
- Introduce R as a viable alternative to costly software
- Support LMIC analysts and institutions in adopting R for HTA
- Share tailored educational resources and workshops

> ðŸ’¡ We believe that open-source tools like R can help bridge the digital and economic divide in health analysis.

## Why Focus on LMICs?

HTA in LMICs is often constrained by:
- Heavy reliance on proprietary software like Microsoft Excel and TreeAge
- Limited budgets and access to advanced tools
- Lack of hands-on, practical R training for HTA analysts

Meanwhile, health systems in LMICs are rapidly evolving, especially under the drive toward **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**. This creates a growing need for:
- Complex modelling (e.g. oncology, rare diseases)
- Scalable and reproducible tools
- Local capacity-building

---

## What We Offer

Our LMIC chapter delivers:
- **Introductory workshops**: Covering R basics and essential HTA packages
- **Advanced tutorials**: Building cost-effectiveness models and interactive apps using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- **Free resources and code**: All available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/) page

## Why R?

**âœ… Scalable**  
R handles complex HTA models more efficiently than spreadsheet-based tools.

**âœ… Reproducible**  
With Git, RMarkdown, and Shiny, models can be:
- Shared with version control
- Easily updated
- Delivered as interactive tools

**âœ… Open and Community-Driven**  
Râ€™s vibrant health economics ecosystem includes:
